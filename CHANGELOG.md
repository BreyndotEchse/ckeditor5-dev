## [38.2.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v38.1.4...v38.2.0) (2023-08-03)

### Features

* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: Added the `skipFileSave` option to the `generateChangelogForMonoRepository()` function that allows returning the changelog entries instead of saving them into the changelog file. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#14601](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/14601). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/0b1b1e3e9a5ae928177468b599ebaf201815711f))
* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: Added  the `nextVersion` option to the `generateChangelogForMonoRepository()` function to pass a predefined version to the function. When using this option, the function no longer interacts with a user. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#14601](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/14601). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/0b1b1e3e9a5ae928177468b599ebaf201815711f))

### Other changes

* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: Extracted `checkVersionAvailability()` function in release tools to a separate util that checks if provided version for a package already exists in npm. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/1afa9362318aefcb6359265d386649c9c6ca497f))
