Changelog
=========

## [34.1.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v34.0.2...v34.1.0) (2023-02-27)

### Features

* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: The `releaseSubrepositories()` task adds the `types` field (if not specified) to `package.json` while publishing packages based on the `main` field if a package is written in TypeScript. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#13518](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/13518). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/e7a7cdeb0fc0e743b6e8eccf34ba59951144639f))
* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: Added a new option for the `releaseSubRepositories()` task that specifies the npm tag used when publishing packages to npm. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#13533](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/13533). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/bcc5a59aa7b8389fb15cb8cf599fb3dd75bef4c9))

### Bug fixes

* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: The `ck-debug-loader` should not be included in TypeScript files to avoid the "Unable to lookup source" error when checking the coverage. Instead, `babel-loader` should handle the `CK_DEBUG` flags. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#13529](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/13529). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/f6ee82e9abc1aaabca8163e367b7c3fb3e03b56b))

## [34.0.2](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v34.0.1...v34.0.2) (2023-02-22)

### Bug fixes

* **[typedoc-plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/typedoc-plugins)**: The `typedoc-plugin-event-inheritance-fixer` plugin should skip the derived class and not try to add any inherited events if the class no longer exists. Perhaps it could be removed from the project by the `typedoc-plugin-purge-private-api-docs` plugin. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/e68c33c0d43ccbae6e707938b4de0f0373d5d0b0))
* **[typedoc-plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/typedoc-plugins)**: The `typedoc-plugin-purge-private-api-docs` plugin should remove the entire structure if it contains no signatures. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/df89a5f501a113d3a686368dafd486a9cdbe4935))

### Other changes

* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: Added the `--no-workspaces-update` flag to the "bumpVersions()" task to avoid the "ETARGET" error. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#13488](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/13488). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/1e10a1546fec9f708841a393fe3a225739537a83))

## [34.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v33.0.1...v34.0.0) (2023-02-20)

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: The code specified in the `CK_DEBUG_*` flags must be valid TypeScript code as it is processed before `ts-loader`.

### Bug fixes

* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: Swapped an order of loaders when processing the TypeScript files. The `ck-debug-loader` is executed before `ts-loader` to avoid the removal of `CK_DEBUG_*` comments from the source code. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#13381](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/13381). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/9438432c5d8572a04fb12311e8bb4527d4023f88))

### Other changes

* **[docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-docs)**: Prevent validating inherited members to get rid of false positive warnings about invalid links. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#13298](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/13298). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/00d89ed06b3fba80193c0f06d590c5723cf0f950))

## [33.0.1](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v33.0.0...v33.0.1) (2023-02-14)

### Bug fixes

* **[docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-docs)**: Specified the "@internal" annotation as "modifierTags" to allow Umberto to identify a member as internal when building docs from TypeScript.

* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: Disabled Chrome backgrounding optimizations in the karma configuration for automated tests to make the tests run in a stable environment that does not depend on the state of the browser window (focus vs. blur). Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#13407](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/13407). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/c6f6c2bf7312af029f15b03f2cf69ea13372abb5))
* **[typedoc-plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/typedoc-plugins)**: Fixed the `tag-event` plugin that crashed when trying to parse event parameters, which are passed as type arguments.

* **[typedoc-plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/typedoc-plugins)**: The `typedoc-plugin-tag-error` should not crash when processing error-like nodes, e.g., `@eventName error`. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#13362](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/13362). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/d07f2de3922f9779dec25079afa171a23bc38e14))

### Other changes

* **[typedoc-plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/typedoc-plugins)**: Excluded non-public structures from the generated Typedoc output when processing private packages.

## [31.1.8](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v31.1.7...v31.1.8) (2022-11-04)

The `v31.1.8` release restores changes introduced in the [`v31.1.6`](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/releases/tag/v31.1.6) version.

We found a different approach to add `DllReferencePlugin` to the webpack configuration for DLL and non-DLL manual tests. Now, they are compiled in separate processes, and the `CKEditor5 is not defined` error should not occur anymore.

### Bug fixes

* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: When processing manual tests, if any of them require a DLL build, the manual test server adds the `DllReferencePlugin` plugin to the webpack configuration to avoid the duplicated modules error when using an import statement behind the `CK_DEBUG_*` flags. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#12791](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/12791). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/01e454ec2f6251b5731abd0a88bbf63059c6516d))

### Other changes

* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: Split DLL and non-DLL manual tests to run separate webpack processes for both groups. They need to be compiled separately because DLL tests require `DllReferencePlugin`, and non-DLL ones must not have it. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/01e454ec2f6251b5731abd0a88bbf63059c6516d))

## [31.1.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v31.0.0...v31.1.0) (2022-09-19)

### Features

* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: The manual test server will detect whether DLL builds are required when compiling manual tests. If so, it asks a user whether to build them before starting to compile tests. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#12190](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/12190). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/71a7f9a4296e671149e4e981c7066ca131923278))

  Feature (tests) Added the `--dll` and `--no-dll` flags to the manual test server. Both are optional and allow avoiding asking whether to build DLL files. When passing `--dll`, the script will build them automatically. When passing `--no-dll`, the process of building DLLs will not be triggered.

## [30.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v29.0.2...v30.0.0) (2022-03-22)

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-utils)**: Upgraded the `postcss` version to 8 and marked the package as peer dependency instead of dependency. Starting from this version, when using the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-utils`, you need to manually install the `postcss` dependency.

### Features

* **[utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-utils)**: The `styles.getPostCssConfig()` function returns a configuration compatible with `postcss@8`. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#11460](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11460). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/bda2a8ec1f0a6e48504be2fd14f577a34a346180))

## [29.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v28.1.1...v29.0.0) (2022-03-18)

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `url` option for `uploadPotFiles()` and `downloadTranslations()` is not supported anymore. Instead, use `organizationName` and `projectName` that represent organization and project names.
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `uploadPotFiles()` task does not read anything from the file system automatically (removed the `translationsDirectory` option). A developer must pass the `cwd` option, which points to the project's root directory. Also, the `packages` map is required, which defines which packages should be processed. Keys in the map represent package names, while their values point to directories where to look for translation sources.

### Features

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Tools for translations use the latest version of the Transifex API (3.0). Improved the UI - these scripts print updates whenever a new step of the process starts. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/a34b57755ad0822b6a1365d4b015ddd41b3c6491))
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `upload()` and `download()` scripts stores resources that could not be processed (e.g., due to network issues). Only packages that failed during the previous run will be processed when re-running. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/a34b57755ad0822b6a1365d4b015ddd41b3c6491))

### Bug fixes

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Fixed `changelog.getChangesForVersion()` util leaking to other releases. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#11322](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11322). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/bca6938240a793ceafb0d5c69708d5fa4d66fa9b))

* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: Karma should not execute the test bundle twice when detecting a change (a macOS case). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/6279bcddded9aed8a6bdeb3ccf3e766bd3b6e1aa))

## [26.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v25.4.5...v26.0.0) (2021-11-18)

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `createPotFiles()` function requires the `translationsDirectory` option, which points to the directory where all `*.po` files will be created.
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `downloadTranslations()` function requires the following properties:`translationsDirectory` - an absolute path used for resolving paths to packages; `url` - Transifex API URL.
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `upload()` function requires the following properties: `translationsDirectory`- points to the directory where all `*.po` files will be created; `url` - Transifex API URL.
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Removed the `ckeditor5-dev-env-translations` binary script as it worked only for the CKEditor 5 project. Use the following functions instead: `const { createPotFiles, uploadPotFiles, downloadTranslations } = require( '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env' );`.
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `uploadPotFiles()` and `downloadTranslations()` functions require the `token` value passed directly to the script. Use the `const getToken = require( '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env/lib/translations/gettoken' )` function for reading the input from the command line.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

Now, the code can be shared in 3rd party plugins created by external developers. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5-package-generator#9](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-package-generator/issues/9). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/048915a7ba24cba8ecb6280bab8dd4b87b8f7a38))
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `createPotFiles()` function accepts new flags:. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/048915a7ba24cba8ecb6280bab8dd4b87b8f7a38))

  *  `ignoreUnusedCorePackageContexts` - when set to `true`, unused contexts from the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core` package will not be displayed as errors,
  * `skipLicenseHeader` - when set to `true`, created `*.po` files will not contain the CKEditor 5 license header.
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `simplifyLicenseHeader()` function accepts a new flag (`simplifyLicenseHeader`) that allows skipping adding the contribute URL in generated `*.po` files.

## [24.2.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v24.1.0...v24.2.0) (2021-02-16)

### Features

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `bumpVersions()` function can read the changelog file from an external directory (using `options.changelogDirectory`). Thanks to that, the private packages from the mono-repository can be released using a public changelog. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/faa1d1e7aafa5f870e038e94b56a8e03fff48e4f))
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `bumpVersions()` function allows skipping upgrading versions of dependencies between updated packages (using `options.skipUpdatingDependencies` which is `false` by default). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/faa1d1e7aafa5f870e038e94b56a8e03fff48e4f))

### Bug fixes

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Simplified a check whether a package was published on NPM in the `releaseSubRepositories()` function. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/faa1d1e7aafa5f870e038e94b56a8e03fff48e4f))
* **[utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-utils)**: A DLL-consumer package produced by webpack should be assigned to the `window` object. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#9039](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9039). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/72c063a3854b6336fcc8528c94887d04b9afa1cf))

### Other changes

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `bumpVersions()` function returns a promise with a collection that contains all updated packages. Previously the promise didn't resolve anything. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/faa1d1e7aafa5f870e038e94b56a8e03fff48e4f))

## [24.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v23.6.1...v24.0.0) (2021-01-11)

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Renamed `options.packageJsonForEmptyReleases` to `options.packageJsonForCustomReleases` in the `releaseSubRepositories()` function.
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Renamed `options.emptyReleases` to `options.customReleases` in the `releaseSubRepositories()` function.

### Features

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The idea of having "emptyReleases" has been changed to "customReleases" that allows specifying which files from the original package should be copied. Introduced the `customReleasesFiles` option for the `releaseSubRepositories()` function. It allows specifying glob patterns of files that should be copied to the temporary directory from which the package will be published on npm. Closes [[ckeditor/ckeditor5#8616](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8616)](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8616). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/763e69d95048f006c6048c0014e574bc23246a8b))
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Added the "--include-external-directory" to the translations:collect task that allows checking packages located in the "external/" directory. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7901](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7901). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/2ab50ca526a7d7f45d5fef0167a8d27728b04233))

## [23.4.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v23.3.0...v23.4.0) (2020-09-02)

### Features

* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: Introduced the `--repositories` (also known as `-r`) option that allows specifying a name of a repository (or repositories, separated by a comma, similar to the `--files` option) where the tool should look for packages that should be tested. Thanks to that, you do not have to specify all packages of a repository that was cloned into the `external/` directory. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7889](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7889). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/1e8edca9f77b8435d5a2b210c5fa9d7a7ab8c11c))

## [23.2.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v23.1.1...v23.2.0) (2020-08-20)

### Features

* **[jsdoc-plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-jsdoc-plugins)**: Introduced a plugin that hides the package documentation if in the package's `package.json` file the `private` key is set to `true`. However, by adding the `@publicApi` annotation, you can mark blocks of the code that should not be hidden. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/374efa83b258e40b36a6451a288e494582f8c5ac))
* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: Manual test server accepts a new flag: `--identity-file` (alias: `-i`) that allows defining global constants in manual tests. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/374efa83b258e40b36a6451a288e494582f8c5ac))

### Other changes

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Improved output displayed while the `translations.upload()` function is working. Instead of displaying `console.log()` after each package, summary tables will be displayed when the function finishes its job. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/fb88a3ed7450c148debbd4bdc5e2a1fbbd82b1f8))
* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: Manual test script will not search for tests in the `./manual/_utils` directory. If any of a manual test requires additional utils to work, those can be placed in the `_utils` directory. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/374efa83b258e40b36a6451a288e494582f8c5ac))

## [23.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v22.0.0...v23.0.0) (2020-07-21)

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[jsdoc-plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-jsdoc-plugins)**: Functions documented in a module will no longer be documented as static functions. Therefore links to functions will not contain the `static-` part and links created in the past will no longer work.

### Features

* **[jsdoc-plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-jsdoc-plugins)**: Updated JSDoc and align custom JSDoc plugins. Part of [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7575](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7575). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/755e29cde71f67332554cb4bc0c23982651bb524))

  * Improved performance,
  * Fixed incorrectly and inconsistently documented functions. Previously they were marked as static/instance using the `.` or `#` symbols. Now they are documented the same as classes, interfaces, and mixins using the `~` symbol. (e.g. `module:widget/utils~toWidget`),
  * Validator was improved, now it detects duplicated modules and previously hidden mistakes.
  * Updated JSDoc allows for modern JS syntax, `async/await` among others.

## [22.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v21.0.0...v22.0.0) (2020-07-20)

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Task `generateChangelogForMonoRepository()` will generate the changelog uses the same version for all packages.

### Features

* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: Added `sinon-chai` to automated tests. Closes https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7456. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/e82040e6a17e87bae6b450df29e5ac7084b5e5be))

### Bug fixes

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `getCommit()` util will return a proper array with commits if the release branch in the project is other than `master`. Due to `--first-parent` flag which is used for collecting the commits, when the release branch is other than `master`, commits made on `master` could not be collected directly from the branch. Now those commits are collected in two ranges: from the last tag to the [base commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge-base) and from the base commit to HEAD and merged together. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7492](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7492). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/e18db62d33c11dbe2a98a845e46cbde73186fa9d))
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Scoped breaking changes notes won't be duplicated in the changelog. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7495](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7495). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/e4eefa669bce9a8d1ccca6ce1c92914a17151825))
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Commit and note groups should be sorted properly. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7496](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7496). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/a08020cbb29bf62cabc28a71926278abe32f54bf))

### Other changes

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `generateChangelogForMonoRepository()` task supports `options.releaseBranch` that is passed directly to the `getCommit()` util. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7492](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7492). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/e18db62d33c11dbe2a98a845e46cbde73186fa9d))
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The changelog generator for mono repository will use the same version for all packages. On the screen, a user will see all changes: `MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES`, `MINOR BREAKING CHANGES`, and all commits since the last release. The user must review it and provide the version. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7323](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7323). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/4036b6e359238db764be695f7491e7e3e85901bd))
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Merge commits between `stable/release/master` branches will be ignored when generating the changelog, to reduce the noise. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7489](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7489). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/cedc53f350aef74621f80f8a2e953d18892f5c52))

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Commits in the changelog will display the word `commit` instead of the first 7 characters from the commit's hash.

Closes [#628](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/issues/628). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/e2048e95181c971c221171e33cde86fe990a97af))
